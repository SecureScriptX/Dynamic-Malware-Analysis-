# Dynamic Malware Analysis

Dynamic malware analysis is a method used to analyze and inspect malware by executing it within secure environments. This approach focuses on understanding the behavior of malicious software, examining activities such as network interactions and file operations in controlled environments.

SOC analysts widely prefer this method due to its ability to provide faster analysis compared to static methods. For a comprehensive understanding of both Static Analysis and Dynamic Analysis methods, refer to our blog post [here](link_to_blog_post).

Various sandbox solutions automate dynamic analysis by running malware in isolated environments and presenting automated analysis results. These sandbox solutions play a crucial role in supporting SOC analysts.

## Advantages of Dynamic Analysis Method

Some advantages of dynamic analysis include:

- **Faster Results:** Dynamic analysis produces results more quickly than static analysis methods.
- **Automation:** Automated analysis is possible using sandboxes.
- **Accessibility:** Requires less technical knowledge than static analysis, making it suitable for beginners.

## Disadvantages of Dynamic Analysis Method

Despite its benefits, dynamic analysis has some limitations:

- **Incomplete Understanding:** It may not provide a full understanding of malware capacity, as behavior can vary across different systems.
- **Limitations with Advanced Malware:** Advanced malware may not be fully analyzed with dynamic methods alone; in such cases, combining dynamic and static analysis methods is advisable.

# Importance of Dynamic Malware Analysis for SOC Analysts
Malware analysis stands out as one of the most crucial responsibilities within SOC, and regardless of your SOC analyst level, dealing with malware is likely a routine part of your job.

### Why Dynamic Analysis over Static Analysis?

Both analysis methods, dynamic and static, possess their unique advantages and drawbacks. Importantly, these methods are not mutually exclusive; rather, they complement each other. To comprehensively analyze malware, it is essential to combine both dynamic and static analysis. This tutorial specifically delves into the realm of Dynamic Analysis.

As a SOC analyst, time is of the essence. The ability to swiftly detect and respond to potential threats is paramount. The dynamic analysis method takes precedence among SOC analysts because it delivers results much faster than static analysis.

The dynamic analysis method, succinctly described as "running the malware and examining its activities," may seem straightforward, but it is a complex and potentially hazardous process for individuals unfamiliar with its intricacies.

# Tools and Software for Dynamic Malware Analysis

To effectively implement the dynamic analysis method, certain software tools are indispensable. Let's explore the essential categories of software required for dynamic malware analysis.

## Virtualization Software

Dynamic analysis necessitates a secure environment separate from our own system to run and observe malware activities. Virtualization Software enables the creation of virtual systems, where different operating systems can be utilized safely for analysis. Note that keeping these virtualization software up-to-date is crucial due to potential vulnerabilities.

Frequently used virtualization software includes:

- VMware Workstation
- VMware Fusion
- Oracle Virtualbox

## Utility Software

Once the virtual operating system is in place, utility software is essential for dynamic analysis. Examples include software needed to analyze office files (e.g., docx, xlsx):

- Microsoft Office
- Adobe Reader
- Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- WinRAR
- Text Editors (Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc.)

Attackers are aware of dynamic analysis methods and check for commonly used software, helping them identify if the malware is running on a virtual operating system.

## Debuggers

Debuggers are crucial for understanding the structure of malware and disabling prevention mechanisms. While not delving into detailed debugging in this beginner-oriented training, installing debuggers now will facilitate future work. Preferred debuggers include:

- Ollydbg
- X64dbg
- Windbg
- Radare2

## Network Monitoring Tools

Malware analysis requires reporting on network connections, addresses communicated with, and communication methods. Network monitoring tools help track these activities. Some examples include:

- Wireshark
- Fiddler
- Burp Suite

## Process Monitoring Tools

Monitoring processes is vital during malware analysis. While Windows Task Manager serves this purpose, other tools offer more features. Consider installing these tools in the virtual operating system:

- Process Hacker
- Process Explorer (SysInternals)
- Procmon (SysInternals)

## File Activity Monitoring Tools

Detecting file activities is crucial in dynamic analysis. Malware engages in various file system activities, from reading files to ensuring persistence. Tools such as Sysmon aid in monitoring and reporting these activities.

- Sysmon

## Other Tools

Additional tools that can enhance dynamic malware analysis:

- SysInternal Tools
- CFF Explorer
- PEView
- TriDNet
- BinText
- PEiD
- Regshot
- HashMyFiles

# Dynamic Malware Analysis Summary

Dynamic malware analysis, involving the execution of malware in secure environments, is a preferred method by SOC analysts due to its speed, automation, and accessibility for beginners.

## Advantages

- **Faster Results:** Swift analysis compared to static methods.
- **Automation:** Utilizes sandboxes for automated analysis.
- **Accessibility:** Requires less technical knowledge.

## Disadvantages

- **Incomplete Understanding:** Behavior variations across systems.
- **Limitations with Advanced Malware:** Combine with static methods for comprehensive analysis.

# Importance for SOC Analysts

Crucial for SOC analysts, dynamic analysis ensures timely threat detection and response, complementing static analysis for a comprehensive understanding of malware.
