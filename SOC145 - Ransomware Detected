## Incident Response
### Risk Assessment via hybrid-analysis

**Ransomware**
- Deletes volume snapshots (frequently employed by ransomware).
- Detected indicators suggesting the presence of ransomware.
- Analysis revealed identification of a known ransomware file.

**Spyware**
- Deletes volume snapshots (commonly associated with ransomware).

**Persistence**
- Installs hooks or patches running processes.
- Generates a significant number of processes.
- Writes data to a remote process.

**Fingerprint**
- Identifies a dropped file containing the Windows username (potential fingerprint attempt).
- Queries kernel debugger information.
- Queries process information.
- Reads system information through Windows Management Instrumentation Commandline (WMIC).
- Reads the active computer name.
- Reads the cryptographic machine GUID.
- Reads the Windows installation language.

**Evasive**
- Contains the ability to check for the presence of a debugger.
- Input file references APIs not listed in its Import Address Table (IAT).
- Potentially implements anti-virtualization techniques.

**Spreading**
- Opens the MountPointManager (often utilized to detect additional infection locations).
- Attempts to access unconventional system drive letters.
