# My Malware Doesnâ€™t Do Anything?

From time to time, when you run malicious software, you may observe no activity on the operating system. Let's explore what actions to take in such a situation.

## Wait a Little Longer

Many sandbox products tag a file as harmless if there's no suspicious activity within a certain timeframe (usually 3-5 minutes) after running the file. Attackers take advantage of this by incorporating sleep functions into their malware, causing malicious code to activate after a delay. Sandboxes may label software with no activity during this time as harmless, allowing it to bypass security products and reach the end user.

If the software shows no activity, it's likely using this method. Be patient for a few minutes to allow activity to manifest.

## Execute as Administrator

Most malware can terminate itself without exhibiting malicious activity when not run at high privileges. Try running non-active malware with an authorized user to observe potential behavior.

## Change Language Settings

As targeted attacks increase, you may find that malicious software only operates within specific targets. Malware may check factors like operating system information, language, location via IP address, and timezone. Create an environment matching these criteria to ensure the malware displays malicious activities.

## Use Different Network

Attackers often develop targeted malware based on geolocation information from IP addresses. If your malware isn't working, enable internet access through different country IP addresses using VPN tools.

*Which country to choose?* There's no definitive answer. Analyze the malware through static analysis or make an educated guess based on the attacker's likely targets. For instance, if the malware is transmitted via email, consider the language of the email to guess potential target countries.

## Other Methods

While the mentioned methods are commonly used, there are additional approaches to try:

- Try running the malware from a different directory.
- Change the screen resolution.
- Perform activities on the operating system while the malware is running (create different processes, move the mouse, write, etc.).
