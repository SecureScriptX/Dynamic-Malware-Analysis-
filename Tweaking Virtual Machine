# Weakening Virtual Machine for Malware Analysis

To prepare the Virtual Machine (VM) for malware analysis, several configuration changes are necessary:

1. **Turn off Anti-Malware Solutions:**
   - Disable Windows Defender to prevent real-time protection from deleting malware files.
   - Use Local Group Policy Editor to ensure Windows Defender is turned off.

2. **Rename Your Virtual Operating System:**
   - Change the hostname to avoid anti-analysis techniques.
   - Update device name and username to mimic a normal user's system.

3. **Turn off Auto Updates:**
   - Disable automatic updates to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Disable Hidden Extensions:**
   - Show file extensions to avoid confusion during analysis.

5. **Show Hidden Files and Folders:**
   - Reveal hidden files and directories for a more comprehensive analysis.

6. **Disable ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization):**
   - Use the Registry Editor to disable ASLR to simplify analysis.

7. **Disable Windows Firewall:**
   - Turn off Windows Defender Firewall to prevent interference with malicious software analysis.

8. **Mimic an End-User System:**
   - Install commonly used browsers (Chrome, Firefox), place files in directories of interest, change desktop background, and download applications to Downloads directory.

9. **Change Network Settings:**
   - Configure virtualization software to prevent malware spreading via network connection.

10. **Take a Snapshot:**
    - Use the Snapshot feature to create a backup before analyzing malware, allowing easy restoration to a clean VM state.

Remember to provide detailed descriptions for each snapshot to facilitate easy retrieval. These steps aim to create an environment conducive to effective and secure malware analysis.
